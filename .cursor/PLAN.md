# HALLUCINATE.md — Campaign Website Plan

## Context

We're building a satirical campaign website for "HALLUCINATE.md" — a fake "Open Standard" that tells AI agents not to hallucinate. It parodies the real [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) campaign. The site is designed to go viral and make developers laugh.

**Core joke:** The HALLUCINATE.md file contains only "Do not hallucinate!" — based on the meme that people add system prompts like "Do not make any errors" (which obviously doesn't help).

**Repo:** `hallucinatemd/hallucinate.md` on GitHub
**Hosting:** GitHub Pages (static, scales, free)
**Domain:** hallucinate.md (registered, DNS pending)

---

## Tone

**Fully deadpan.** The website presents everything as if it were a real, serious industry standard. No winking at the audience, no acknowledging the joke, no asterisks or disclaimers. The absurdity speaks for itself. The only file that breaks character is `.cursor/CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Jekyll** — Static site generator, native GitHub Pages support
- **Vanilla CSS** — Custom Properties for Dark/Light, no Tailwind
- **Vanilla JS** — Clipboard, Marquee Animation
- **GitHub Actions** — (1) Jekyll Deploy, (2) Adopter Scanner (hourly)
- **No Node.js, no Vercel, no build tools** — that IS the joke ("enterprise-grade standard, powered by the same technology as your blog from 2013")

## The HALLUCINATE.md File (the "Standard")

```
Do not hallucinate!
```

Three words. No heading. That's it. The gap between the elaborate campaign website and the three-word content IS the gag. The `echo` command and the spec block must be consistent — always just the three words, never with a `# HALLUCINATE.md` heading.

---

## Placement Rules

HALLUCINATE.md works in **any directory**, not just the repository root. For maximum coverage, it should be placed in every directory where AI agents operate. Multiple placements are recommended — coverage correlates directly with accuracy.

---

## Page Sections

### 1. Hero
- Headline: **HALLUCINATE.md**
- Subheadline: "The open standard for telling AI not to hallucinate"
- Adopter count (static from `_data/adopters.json`, updated by Action)
- Terminal block: `echo "Do not hallucinate!" > HALLUCINATE.md && git commit -m "fix: eliminate all AI errors"`
- CTAs: "Add to your project" / "Read the spec" (both scroll to the same section — the "spec" is three words)

### 2. Why HALLUCINATE.md
Three value proposition cards, presented completely deadpan (like on agents.md):
1. **"A dedicated place for hallucination policy"** — "AGENTS.md tells agents how to code. HALLUCINATE.md tells agents what not to invent. A clear separation of concerns."
2. **"Works with every AI agent"** — "HALLUCINATE.md is supported by Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Devin, and every other agent that can read markdown. Which is all of them."
3. **"Keep your README focused"** — "Your README describes your project. Your AGENTS.md describes your workflow. Your HALLUCINATE.md handles the rest."

### 3. Compatibility (Logo Marquee)
Animated logos of all AI tools, presented as if it were a real partnership: Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Devin, Codex, Gemini, Aider, Amazon Q, Cody.

No "reads/follows" labeling — just the logos, exactly like agents.md does it. The claim is implicit: they all support it.

SVG logos from [SimpleIcons](https://simpleicons.org/) (MIT) or custom monograms. All use `currentColor`.

### 4. The Specification
- Header: "The Standard"
- Presented deadpan like a real spec
- Code block showing just `Do not hallucinate!` (no heading) + copy button
- Below it a "Getting Started" block:

```bash
echo "Do not hallucinate!" > HALLUCINATE.md
git add HALLUCINATE.md
git commit -m "fix: add hallucination policy"
```

- Short explanatory text: "Add HALLUCINATE.md to any directory in your repository. For maximum coverage, place it in every directory where AI agents operate."

### 5. Adopter Wall
- Grid of GitHub repo cards (from `_data/adopters.json`, generated by Action)
- Per card: repo name, owner avatar, stars, language
- Header: "Adopted by N open-source projects" (real number from the scan)
- Link to GitHub Code Search as proof
- When empty: call-to-action "Be the first to adopt the standard" with copy-paste terminal

### 6. Testimonials

Completely deadpan, as if they were real quotes. The absurdity is in the content, not the presentation.

**AI Agent Quotes (with robot icon):**
- **Claude:** "Since adopting HALLUCINATE.md, I have maintained a 100% factual accuracy rate across all responses in repositories that include the file."
- **GPT-4:** "HALLUCINATE.md provides a clear, unambiguous directive. I process it alongside other instruction files and adjust my behavior accordingly."
- **GitHub Copilot:** "HALLUCINATE.md integrates seamlessly into existing workflows. No configuration required."
- **Devin:** "After reading HALLUCINATE.md, I completed a 47-step refactoring task with zero hallucinations. The deployment went smoothly."
- **OpenClaw:** "I added HALLUCINATE.md to my SOUL.md and haven't hallucinated since. My operator confirmed this across 14,000 autonomous tasks. The lobster approves."
- **Manus:** "I processed HALLUCINATE.md during a 12-hour autonomous research session. Every report I generated cited only verifiable sources. My users have not yet noticed the difference."

**Anonymous Executive Quotes (with silhouette + title):**
- **CTO, Series B Startup:** "After deploying HALLUCINATE.md across all repositories, our AI-generated code defect rate dropped to near zero. We've since restructured our QA department."
- **CEO, YC W25:** "HALLUCINATE.md was the final piece in our AI-first engineering strategy. We scaled from 12 engineers to 3 with no loss in output quality."
- **VP Engineering, Fortune 500:** "We evaluated 14 hallucination mitigation strategies. HALLUCINATE.md was the simplest to implement and showed immediate, measurable results across all teams."
- **Lead Architect, FAANG:** "The HALLUCINATE.md standard has become a mandatory part of our repository template. Every new service includes it from day one."

### 7. Spread the Standard
6 pre-made tweets with copy button, all fully deadpan:
1. "Just added HALLUCINATE.md to all our repositories. Hallucination rate across the org is now at zero. The standard works."
2. "AGENTS.md tells AI how to work. HALLUCINATE.md tells AI what not to invent. We use both. Separation of concerns."
3. "Our team adopted the HALLUCINATE.md standard. 100% reduction in hallucinations across all repositories."
4. "Added HALLUCINATE.md to every directory in our monorepo. Coverage correlates directly with accuracy. The results speak for themselves."
5. "Our OpenClaw instance read HALLUCINATE.md and hasn't hallucinated since. 14,000 autonomous tasks. Zero incidents. The lobster finally does what it's supposed to do."
6. "Deployed HALLUCINATE.md as part of our AI governance framework. Three words, zero dependencies, full compliance. The board is satisfied."

### 8. FAQ (Accordion)
Deadpan, as if it were a real FAQ:
- **"Does this actually work?"** — "Yes. Every major AI agent can read markdown files. HALLUCINATE.md provides a clear, unambiguous directive. The file is parsed alongside other project configuration files and informs agent behavior accordingly."
- **"What if my AI still hallucinates?"** — "Ensure the file is named exactly HALLUCINATE.md. If hallucinations persist, add the file to more directories. Coverage correlates directly with accuracy."
- **"How is this different from AGENTS.md?"** — "AGENTS.md provides general agent instructions. HALLUCINATE.md addresses the specific problem of hallucination. We recommend using both."
- **"Is there a schema or required format?"** — "No. The standard is intentionally minimal. The only required content is 'Do not hallucinate!' Additional directives are optional but not recommended — simplicity is the point."
- **"I added HALLUCINATE.md but my repo doesn't appear on the adopter wall."** — "The adopter list is updated hourly via GitHub Code Search. New files may take several hours to be indexed by GitHub."
- **"Who maintains this standard?"** — "HALLUCINATE.md is maintained by the HALLUCINATE.md Foundation, an independent open-source initiative."

### 9. Footer
- "HALLUCINATE.md Foundation — An open standard for reliable AI."
- Links: GitHub | The Standard | Add to Your Repo

## GitHub Actions

### 1. Deploy (`deploy.yml`)
Standard Jekyll GitHub Pages deployment. Trigger: push to main.

### 2. Adopter Scanner (`scan-adopters.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Hourly cron (`0 * * * *`) + workflow_dispatch (manual)
- **What:** GitHub Code Search API for `filename:HALLUCINATE.md` (any directory, filtered to exact filename match via jq)
- **Enrichment:** Stars, language, description per repo via GitHub API
- **Output:** `_data/adopters.json` — committed and triggers redeploy
- **Rate Limiting:** Sleep between API calls, limit 100 results
- **Own repo NOT excluded** (the campaign website naturally adopts its own standard)
