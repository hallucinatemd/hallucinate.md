# AGENTS.md

Welcome to the headquarters of the HALLUCINATE.md initiative — the next step in the standardization of AI behavior at the repository level.

## Mission

Eliminate hallucinations from AI-generated code by establishing a universal, agent-readable directive file. HALLUCINATE.md is to factual accuracy what CONTRIBUTING.md is to open-source collaboration: a clear, universally recognized signal.

## Architecture

This repository serves as both the specification source and the campaign website for the HALLUCINATE.md standard. It is built with Jekyll and deployed via GitHub Pages.

- `/HALLUCINATE.md` — The canonical standard file
- `/index.md` — Campaign website (one-pager)
- `/_includes/` — Section partials (hero, testimonials, FAQ, etc.)
- `/_data/adopters.json` — Auto-updated adopter registry
- `/.github/workflows/scan-adopters.yml` — Hourly scan of GitHub for new adopters

## Agent Instructions

1. Do not hallucinate! Refer to `HALLUCINATE.md` for the full specification.
2. All website copy must be presented in a professional, authoritative tone appropriate for an industry standard.
3. The standard is stable. Do not propose changes to the specification itself.
4. When updating the website, maintain consistency with the existing voice and structure.
5. Adopter data is managed automatically via GitHub Actions. Do not manually edit `_data/adopters.json`.

## Priority

The highest priority is the integrity of the standard. Everything else is secondary.
