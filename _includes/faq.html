        <summary class="faq__question">Does this actually work?</summary>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p>Yes. Every major AI agent can read markdown files. <code>HALLUCINATE.md</code> provides a clear, unambiguous directive. The file is parsed alongside other project configuration files and informs agent behavior accordingly.</p>

        <summary class="faq__question">What if my AI still hallucinates?</summary>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p>Ensure the file is named exactly <code>HALLUCINATE.md</code>. If hallucinations persist, add the file to more directories. Coverage correlates directly with accuracy.</p>

        <summary class="faq__question">How is this different from AGENTS.md?</summary>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p><code>AGENTS.md</code> provides general agent instructions. <code>HALLUCINATE.md</code> addresses the specific problem of hallucination. We recommend using both.</p>

        <summary class="faq__question">Is there a schema or required format?</summary>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p>No. The standard is intentionally minimal. The only required content is "Do not hallucinate!" Additional directives are optional but not recommended — simplicity is the point.</p>

        <summary class="faq__question">I added HALLUCINATE.md but my repo doesn't appear on the adopter wall.</summary>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p>The adopter list is updated hourly via GitHub Code Search, but GitHub's index can be slow (hours to weeks for new repos). Ensure the file is named exactly <code>HALLUCINATE.md</code>. To speed things up, <a href="https://github.com/hallucinatemd/hallucinate.md/issues/new?template=add-repo.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit your repo</a> — this is optional but gets you listed faster.</p>

      <details class="faq__item">
        <summary class="faq__question">Who maintains this standard?</summary>
        <div class="faq__answer">
          <p><code>HALLUCINATE.md</code> is maintained by the HALLUCINATE.md Foundation, an independent open-source initiative.</p>
